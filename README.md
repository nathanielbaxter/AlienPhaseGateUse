AlienPhaseGateUse
=================

Allows aliens in Natural Selection 2 to use marine phase gates.

For licensing reasons none of the Natural Selection 2 code is included in this
repository. Instead the GenerateMod.py file is included so you can generate
the lua/Alien.lua file which is the mod. This is also done for convience, so
that updating this mod for newer versions of NS2 is easy.

GenerateMod.py: Generates the 'Alien Phase Gate Use' mod's lua/Alien.lua file.
  Usage: python GenerateMod.py luadir
  -- luadir: Location of the folder containing the clean Alien.lua file.
